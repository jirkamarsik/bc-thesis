% The book notice environment
% ===========================
% The text of the book notice must appear in its own environment. The book
% title, author, publisher and the name of a person writing the notice are
% entered as an argument of the booknotice environment:

\begin{booknotice}{title={Pig, Pepper, Baby}, published={Duchess, June 1234},
                   author=Alice, noticed=White Rabbit}

% The braces are mandatory only if the value contains a comma as in the first
% (title) and second (published) attribute but they never make any harm, you
% can safely put all values into braces.


% The body of the book notice
% ===========================
% The text of the book notice must not use any sectioning command. Figures
% and tables are allowed in exceptional cases.
