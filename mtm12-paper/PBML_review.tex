% This is a sample file for the PBML book review.
% See PBML_article.tex for detailed information about XeLaTeX etc.

\documentclass{pbml}
% The review should not require any package.
\begin{document}


% The book title, book author, publisher and reviewer
% ===================================================
% Due to journal organization the review information  must be specified
% AFTER \begin{document}. Give the information as:

\PBMLreview{title={Pig, Pepper, Baby}, published={Duchess, June 1234},
            author=Alice, reviewed=White Rabbit}

% The braces are mandatory only if the value contains a comma as in the first
% (title) and second (published) attribute but they never make any harm, you
% can safely put all values into braces.

% The body of the review
% ======================
% The reviews usually have no sectioning but you can use sections, tables and
% figures similarly as in an article.
