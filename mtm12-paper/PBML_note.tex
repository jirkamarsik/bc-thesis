% This is a sample file for the PBML note.
% See PBML_article.tex for detailed information about XeLaTeX etc.

\documentclass{pbml}
% The note should not require any package.
\begin{document}


% Note title and author
% =====================
% Due to journal organization the note title and author must be specified
% AFTER \begin{document}. Give the information as:

\PBMLnote{title={Pig, Pepper, Baby}, author=Alice}

% The braces are mandatory only if the value contains a comma as in the first
% attribute (title) but they never make any harm, you can safely put all
% values into braces.


% The body of the note
% ====================
% The notes usually have no sectioning but you can use sections, tables and
% figures similarly as in an article.
